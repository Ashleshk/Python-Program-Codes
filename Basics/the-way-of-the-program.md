# ThinkPython: The way of the program

ThinkPython is a free Python book. Its first chapter is about
programming in general. [Read it
here.](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2002.html).

Read the glossary also, but don't study it too much. Some things in it
are useful to know, but I think studying it carefully would be really
boring. Also do all exercises except the last one. It's more about
math skills than learning Python.

When you're done reading, read the summary below and make sure you've
learned everything.

## Summary

- Now you should have some kind of idea about what programming is.
- Each value has a type, and you can find that out with `type(value)`.
    For example, writing `type(123)` to the Python prompt does the same
    thing as writing `int` to the prompt.
- Types and classes are the same thing (in Python 3).
- Some of the most commonly used types are:
    - int is short for integer. `1` and `2` are integers.
    - float is short for floating point number. `1.0` and `3.14` are
        floats.
    - str is short for string. `"hello"` and `'hello'` are strings. It
        doesn't matter if you use 'single quotes' or "double quotes",
        they do the same thing in Python.

## More exercises

1. What happens if you use + between two strings, like
    `"hello" + "world"`? How about `"hello" * "world"`?
2. What happens if you use + between a string and an integer, like
    `"hello" + 3`? How about `"hello" * 3`?
3. What happens if you use + between a float and an integer, like
    `0.5 + 3`? How about `0.5 * 3`?
