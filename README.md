# Python programming tutorial

This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think
that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code
examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy
words. If you have never programmed before click
[here](basics/what-is-programming.md) to find out what programming is
like and get started.

This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all
or very little programming experience. If you have programmed a lot in
the past using some other language you may want to read [the official
tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.
