# Python programming tutorial

This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think
that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code
examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy
words. If you have never programmed before click
[here](basics/what-is-programming.md) to find out what programming is
like and get started.

This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all
or very little programming experience. If you have programmed a lot in
the past using some other language you may want to read [the official
tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.

You can use Python 3.5 or any newer Python with this tutorial. **Don't
use Python 2 because it's no longer supported.**

### Advanced

If you want to learn more advanced techniques, you can also read this
section. Most of the techniques explained here are great when you're
working on a large project, and your code would be really repetitive
without these things.

You can experiment with these things freely, but please **don't use these
techniques just because you know how to use them.** Prefer the simple
techniques from the Basics part instead when possible. Simple is better
than complex.

1. [Handy data types](https://github.com/Ashleshk/Python-Program-Codes/blob/master/advanced/datatypes.md)
2. [Advanced stuff with functions](https://github.com/Ashleshk/Python-Program-Codes/blob/master/advanced/functions.md)
3. [Magic methods](https://github.com/Ashleshk/Python-Program-Codes/blob/master/advanced/magicmethods.md)
4. [Iterables, iterators and generators](https://github.com/Ashleshk/Python-Program-Codes/blob/master/advanced/iters.md)
