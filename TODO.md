# Stuff that will (hopefully) be added to this tutorial

This tutorial is not complete. It still needs:

- replacement for the thinkpython linking file
    - what is a type and why it matters
        - also add `type()` calls to other places, especially when
          introducing tuples (thanks kodec), functions and modules
    - `3.14` and `'3.14'`
    - `# 'hello'` and `'# hello'`
- range somewhere
- **More exercises and examples everywhere!**
    - especially "fix this" exercises
- classes part 1:

        <deniska> Akuli: I would probably add an example of refactoring
                  a bunch of functions working with shared global data
                  into a class because it's a pretty typical usecase

- classes part 2
    - non-public `_variables`
    - "singular" inheritance, inheritance of built-in classes
    - using super
    - advise to avoid multiple inheritance
