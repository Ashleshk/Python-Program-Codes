# Stuff that will (hopefully) be added to this tutorial

This tutorial is not complete. It still needs:

- replacement for the thinkpython linking file
    - what is a type and why it matters
        - also add `type()` calls to other places, especially when
          introducing tuples (thanks kodec), functions and modules
    - `3.14` and `'3.14'`
    - `# 'hello'` and `'# hello'`
