# Advanced

If you want to learn more advanced techniques, you can also read this
section. Most of the techniques explained here are great when you're
working on a large project, and your code would be really repetitive
without these things.

You can experient with these things freely, but please **don't use these
techniques just because you know how to use them.** Prefer the simple
techniques from the Basics part instead when possible. Simple is better
than complex.

4. [Iterables, iterators and generators](iters.md)
