# Getting help

When you have a problem with Python, you're not alone! There are many
places to ask for help in.

## IRC

IRC is the oldest chatting service I know, but as of 2018, it's still
in use, and a great way to get help in Python. You don't need to
register anywhere, just click one of the links below and you're good to
go.

- [##learnpython](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/##learnpython) and
    [##python-friendly](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/##python-friendly)
    are beginner-friendly Python support channels. In my experience,
    people here tend to understand beginners' problems better, so you
    probably want to go to one of these.
- [#python](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/#python) is
    the official Python channel. If you have questions about advanced
    topics or you need help quickly, go there. However, this channel
    requires
    [registering on freenode](http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-Nickname-on-Freenode).

Make your question short. If you want to post a code example that is
more than two lines long, post it [here](http://dpaste.com/) first.
Just copy-paste your code to the big text area and click the "Paste it"
button, and then post a link to your paste on IRC.

Do this:

    <you>   i'm trying to check if this variable equals one but i keep
            getting an error http://dpaste.com/yourpaste

Don't do this:

    <you>   HEEEEELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
    <you>     File "hello.py", line 3
    <you>       if a = b:
    <you>            ^
    <you>   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

## Websites to ask help on

Personally, I've never asked a question on any of these sites. Getting
help on IRC is much faster.

- [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a question/answer site
    for programmers. Search for your question first, maybe someone has
    already asked that and it has been answered.
- At the time of writing this,
    [the learnpython subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)
    is another good place to ask Python questions on.
