# What should I do now?

You are now at the end of this tutorial. This means that you're almost
ready to do something fun with Python. This page contains a bunch of
links to other useful and fun Python resources.

## What the heck is this?

Sometimes you'll come across things that I haven't shown in this
tutorial. Here's a table of things you'll probably come across:

### A dictionary without a `:`

These are actually [sets](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets),
not dictionaries. However, `{}` is a dictionary.

### yield stuff

The [yield keyword](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do)
is a way to create generators

| What you see              | What it is                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| a dictionary without `:`  | [a set]                              |
| yield stuff               |     |
| `import stuff as thing`   | imports stuff and sets the module to a thing variable                                             |
| `from stuff import thing` | about the same as `import stuff` and after that
| `from stuff import *`     | imports everything

## Fun modules
